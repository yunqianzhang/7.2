# Practical 7.2: Sound Design
Your goal for this practical is to design and add sound to an environment to further enhance the narrative and user experience of the environment. 

You can choose to either:
1.	Use the prebuilt environment I have provided here(only if you can't access option 2 or 3!), 
2.	Use the environment you designed in the week 4 practical,  
3.	Use the adventure game environment from the week 6/7 practicals. 

## Task 0: Finding sound files
For this practical, and when making your own interactive environments, you will have to find your own sounds, both music and sound effects. There are many ways you can do this. Explore the different options below to see what is available. 
1.	Unity asset store - The asset store has a fairly decent collection of free audio samples including specific sound effects for different game types and themes 
2.	3rd party websites – There are many websites that provide free audio clips to use for your environments. Remember to read the licensing rules if using these in your assessments! 
    1. http://soundbible.com/
    2. http://freesound.org/
3.	Make/edit your own! – You can download music or sounds and edit them in Audition/Audacity. This gives you finer control over the sound clips before you import them into Unity. You can also record dialogue and modify the pitch and other effects to add dialogue for multiple characters. 

## Task 1: Foley
Take some time to think of different sound effects that you can add to your environment. Some things you can add to your environments are explained below. 
- Footsteps:
  - The current FPS controller uses a looping sound effect for walking which is provided for you in the standard assets. Try and add a different sound effect for walking. 
  - What about the material or floor your character is walking on? Walking on a metallic surface will have different sounds to walking on carpet. You can use collision triggers to change the footstep sound clip when changings surfaces. 
- Alarms/Beeps:
  - Think about possible sounds that could warn a player of upcoming danger or other events. This could be in the form of a beeping alarm, a malfunctioning computer system or a hidden object that can be found by using 3D sound to get the player’s attention. 
- Environmental sound effects 
  - The corridors in the prebuilt environment have pipes running throughout the environment. You can add sound effects to show the pipes are leaking or simulate the release of a poisonous gas! 
  - Think about what other objects in the adventure game or the corridor scene could benefit from sound effects. 
  
## Task 2: Atmos
Atmospheric sounds lets your players infer a lot about the environment. Like sound effects, here are some possible things you can add to your environment: 
- Time of day / weather: 
  - Even in an indoor scene, you can provide sound for rain/thunder/lightning to simulate what is going on outside the building. 
  - Think about how the sounds of a forest might change if you are exploring it in the day versus the night. 
- Player state: 
  - Sprinting usually makes people tired. You could consider adding in sound to mirror the status of the player depending on how long the sprint button has been pressed down. 
- Background/White noise: 
  - Often there is always some noise in a 3D environment. This can be in the form of random machine noises in the background, nature noises if outdoors or even just plain white noise. Think about what works best for your environment when the player is exploring but not triggering specific events. 
 
## Task 3: Music 
Finally, music both as part of gameplay, and in the background is an important part of most 3D environments. Think about factors like: 
- Pace:
  - The pace of background music can foreshadow events and add to the overall player experience. Think about background music and pace that might match your environment.
  - You can cue different pieces of music with different pace depending on where the player is in your environment 
- Diagetic or not? 
  - When adding music, consider if it is only going to be as a background sound or something that has a source in the environment. 
  
## Task 4: Test it out!
Ask the person next to you or one of the teaching team to walk/play through your environment!

## Optional extensions: 
- Dialogue: Record a tutorial or introduction sequence to your environment through dialogue. Think about the character who is giving these instructions. Is it breaking the 4th wall or is the dialogue provided as a character in the narrative? 
- Player selected sounds: In many AAA games, players can change the background music when travelling from location to location. Try and write a script that allows players to change the background music through some simple keyboard inputs.
